-Technical Documentation (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation.html)

Supporting documentation on code lists, subject definitions, data accuracy, and statistical testing can be found on the American Community Survey website in the  Technical Documentation section. (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/code-lists.html)

Sample size and data quality measures (including coverage rates, allocation rates, and response rates) can be found on the American Community Survey website in the Methodology section. (https://www.census.gov/acs/www/methodology/sample_size_and_data_quality/)

Although the American Community Survey (ACS) produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities, and towns and estimates of housing units for states and counties.

Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted roughly as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, see ACS Technical Documentation https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation.html). The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables.",5/1/23,1,78,1,1,5337805,,1/1/19,year,Virginia Means of Transportation to Work by Vehicles Available by Census Tract (ACS 5-Year),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.534762343,0.558556562,0.569749531,0.615487342,0.322599898,0.094984518,0.401368013,0.025210464

METHODOLOGY NOTES (across all datasets for this indicator)
The Census Transportation Planning Package is produced only every five years and relies upon 5-year rolling average data for all data tables. In order to analyze trends related to the Bay Area, commute patterns were evaluated for all interactions between the nine Bay Area counties and for all interactions between other California counties and any Bay Area county. Commute flows between non-California counties and the San Francisco Bay Area were assumed to be negligible.",5/1/23,1,22,2,1,145273,,1/1/19,year,Vital Signs: Commute Patterns - Bay Area,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.57976335,0.363003458,0.573031127,0.942510323,0.532782653,0.445845796,0.401326004,0.025240015

Although the American Community Survey (ACS) produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities, and towns and estimates of housing units for states and counties.

Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted roughly as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, see ACS Technical Documentation https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation.html). The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables.",5/1/23,1,246,1,1,1007747,,1/1/19,year,Virginia Means of Transportation to Work by Travel Time to Work for Workplace Geography - County (ACS 5-Year),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.773296274,0.153518765,0.614015383,0.582273934,0.409178154,0.067883459,0.401368086,0.025210318

 This workbook provides data and data dictionaries for the SFMTA 2019 Travel Decision Survey.

On behalf of San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA), Corey, Canapary & Galanis (CC&G) undertook a Mode Share Survey within the City and County of San Francisco as well as the eight surrounding Bay Area counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, San Mateo, Marin, Santa Clara, Napa, Sonoma and Solano.

The primary goals of this study were to:
• Assess percent mode share for travel in San Francisco for evaluation of the SFMTA Strategic Objective 2.2: Mode Share target of 80% sustainable travel by 2030. 
• Evaluate the above statement based on the following parameters: number of trips to, from, and within San Francisco by Bay Area residents. Trips by visitors to the Bay Area and for commercial purposes are not included.
• Provide additional trip details, including trip purpose for each trip in the mode share question series.
• Collect demographic data on the population of Bay Area residents who travel to, from, and within San Francisco.
• Collect data on travel behavior and opinions that support other SFMTA strategy and project evaluation needs.

The survey was conducted as a telephone study among 801 Bay Area residents aged 18 and older. Interviewing was conducted in English, Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Tagalog. Surveying was conducted via random digit dial (RDD) and cell phone sample.
All survey datasets incorporate respondent weighting based on age and home location; utilize the “weight” field when appropriate in your analysis.

The survey period for this survey is as follows:
2019: May - August 2019

The margin of error is related to sample size (n). For the total sample, the margin of error is 3.3% for a confidence level of 95%. When looking at subsets of the data, such as just the SF population, just the female population, or just the population of people who bicycle, the sample size decreases and the margin of error increases. Below is a guide of the margin of error for different samples sizes. Be cautious in making conclusions based off of small sample sizes.

At the 95% confidence level is:
• n = 801(Total Sample). Margin of error = +/- 3.3%

These have been tabulated from raw trip record submissions made by bases to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). 

This dataset is typically updated monthly on a two-month lag, as bases have until the conclusion of the following month to submit a month of trip records to the TLC. In example, a base has until Feb 28 to submit complete trip records for January. Therefore, the January base aggregates will appear in March at the earliest. The TLC may elect to defer updates to the FHV Base Aggregate Report if a large number of bases have failed to submit trip records by the due date.

Note: The TLC publishes base trip record data as submitted by the bases, and we cannot guarantee or confirm their accuracy or completeness. Therefore, this may not represent the total amount of trips dispatched by all TLC-licensed bases.

What is Open Space?
Open spaces include all outdoor land and water that is publicly owned, and/or publicly accessible. Open spaces can be parks, plazas, boulevards, main streets, ceremonial spaces, natural and protected areas, community gardens, sports fields, and green infrastructure.

What is the Green Network Strategy?
Edmonton’s Green Network Strategy will examine how open space in the City of Edmonton functions as an integrated network of public spaces that provide real, measureable value to Edmontonians. Open spaces contribute to human health and wellness, improve the urban environment, and provide places for people to come together. These contributions are the central themes of the Green Network Strategy, and provide the organizing framework for assessing open space:
    •    Ecology: Supports and enhances the environment 
    •    Wellness: Promotes healthy living
    •    Celebration: Connects people to each other and builds a sense of place.

The Survey
By completing this survey, you are providing valuable information that will help the City of Edmonton develop an integrated network of open spaces that meets the needs and priorities of Edmontonians.

The ACS replaces what until 2000 was the Long Form of the census; both have been based on surveys of a partial sample of people. The ACS sample is so small that surveys from five years must be combined to be reliable. The 2013-2017 ACS is the most recent grouping of 5 years of data. ACS data have been proportioned to conform with 2010 Census total population and total households.,5/1/23,1,211,0,0,435842,,1/1/19,,2013-2017 American Community Survey Detailed Census Tract Data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.05,0.527871489,0.406848738,0.701440696,0.708379446,0.112134425,0.400714013,0.02036796

COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. It includes the three measurements; Phase I (30 October 2020 and 14 December 2020), Phase II (2 March 2021 and 22 March 2021) and Phase III.

The first phase built the foundation for the wider suite of data collection approaches and research methods used in the Viral Communication project by allowing respondents to opt-in to multiple research pathways.

Overall sample frame (Phase I): N = 1480

Phase II sample frame: N = 482

Phase III sample frame: N = 426

Computed variables such as weights, groupings (experimental set-ups), and composite scores are included in the dataset.
